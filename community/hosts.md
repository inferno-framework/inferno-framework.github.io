### Note
[inferno.healthit.gov](https://inferno.healthit.gov) is the officially supported public 
host for Inferno, and is regularly updated with approved stable releases of Inferno Core and supported Test Kits. 

[inferno-qa.healthit.gov](https://inferno-qa.healthit.gov) is provided for quality assurance
testing and demonstration of upcoming Test Kits or development releases of Inferno Core.
It is likely to be updated without notice and should only be used by those with a need
to work with pre-release Test Kits or Inferno Core features under development.

Both hosts are for demonstration purposes only, and should not be used with any sensitive data or Protected Health Information (PHI).
