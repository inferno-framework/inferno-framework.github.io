## Reporting Issues

We welcome feedback on the Test Kits that we have developed[^1], including but not limited to the following areas:

- Validation logic, such as potential bugs, lax checks, and unexpected failures.
- Requirements coverage, such as requirements that have been missed, tests that necessitate features that the IG does not require, or other issues with the interpretation of the IG's requirements.
- User experience, such as confusing or missing information in the test UI.

Please report any issues on the given Test Kit's Issues page on [our GitHub](https://github.com/inferno-framework).
