Welcome to new home of the Inferno Framework!

The Inferno Framework is a methodology and a set of tools that help you create,
share and execute tests for systems implementing FHIR-based capabilities.
Inferno began as a test tool targeting US Core and the SMART App Launch Guide,
but has grown into a more flexible and reusable test application framework. We
are launching this improved site to make it easier for others to learn how to
use Inferno to test their own data exchange needs.

### Providing a more holistic view of Inferno

As Inferno as grown, so too has the needs of the site that hosts it.  While
we strive to make Inferno as self-explanatory and easy to use as possible,
providing documentation about how it works and how to use it is necessary
given the size and scope of the project.

This revamped documentation site marks a departure from its predecessor by
providing more space for describing all components of Inferno and how
it can be used by different stakeholders.  The previous iteration primarily
focused on the technical components of Inferno, which is just one aspect
of the Inferno Framework.

This revamped documentation site also consolodates resources that are published
in different spots, providing a single source for content about Inferno.
Previously scattered across multiple platforms, essential materials like API references, best practices, and advanced concepts are now centralized.  This one-stop site
ensures that users have immediate access to all content related to Inferno.

## Introducing News and Updates

Inferno is under very active development using an iterative development
approach.  As such, it is continually being updated and improved.  We've
included a 'News and Updates' section of the site that is designed to keep users
informed about the latest advancements in the Inferno Frameworks.  This will
cover a range of topics from minor bug fixes to major releases, ensuring that
developers have the information they need to stay current.

## Embracing Community Contributions

This new site also introduces a new [Community](/community) section that is
dedicated to highlighting community contributions to the Inferno ecosystem.
These types of contributions may include:
* **Inferno Test Kits**: stand-alone testing applicatons built using the Inferno Framework
that target new data exchange use cases.
* **Inferno Hosts**: While inferno can be downloaded and run locally, you are free
to host Inferno in a shared environment that is available for use by others.  The
primary shared host is currently [Inferno on HealthIT.gov](https://inferno.healthit.gov),
which is operated by the Office of the National Coordinator for HealthIT.  However,
we encourage others to stand up their own instances as well.
* **Inferno Components**: Inferno is an open source library and can be extended
as needed. We plan to curate extensions to Inferno that can be resused by the community,
to help ensure that all work is leveraged to its maximum extend.

## Looking Forward

This update to the Inferno Framework site is just the beginning. The team plans to
improve and fill out the content on the site over time.  And as always, the
team welcomes feedback and ideas for improvements.
