# About Inferno

Welcome to Inferno, an open source software testing framework for the [HL7®
FHIR®](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) standard for health care data exchange.
{: .lead }

Inferno's goal is to accelerate the availability of interoperable Health IT
systems connected using the FHIR standard by providing
**easy to use**, **portable**, and **comprehensive test tools** that
support interoperable implementations of FHIR-based systems.


Inferno is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) application framework that test
authors use to create fully automated tests for FHIR-based APIs.  These tests
are packaged into portable testing applications called Test Kits.  For more
information on how to use Inferno to test your FHIR-enabled use case, visit the
[Concepts](/docs/concepts.html) section of this site.  The
[examples](examples.html) portion of this site describes several Test Kits that
have been created using Inferno to test different use cases as described by FHIR
implementation guides.

Development of Inferno is sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator
for Health IT in support of the Certified Health IT Program.  Development is led
by The MITRE Corporation.  For more information about the history of Inferno,
please visit the [History](history.html) section of this site.
