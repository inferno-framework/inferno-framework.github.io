Development of Inferno is principally sponsored by the Assistant Secretary for
Technology Policy (ASTP) / the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT
(ONC) in support of the ONC Certified Health IT Program.  Development of Inferno
was initially conducted by the MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit organization
working in the public interest.

The fastest way to reach the current Inferno development team is via the
