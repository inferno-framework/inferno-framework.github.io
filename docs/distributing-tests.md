# Distributing Tests

Inferno allows test kits to be distributed like regular ruby gems. In order to
make your test suite available to others, first it needs to be organized as
described in [Test
Organization](/inferno-core/repo-layout-and-organization.html#test-organization).

Then, you must fill in the information in the `gemspec` file in the root of the
repository. The name of the file should match `spec.name` within the file and
the name of the main file in `lib`. Using the US Core example from above, this
file would be named `us_core_test_kit.gempsec` and `spec.name` would be
`'us_core_test_kit'`. There are [recommended naming conventions for
gems](https://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/).

**Optional:** Once your gemspec file has been updated, you can publish your gem
on [rubygems, the official ruby gem repository](https://rubygems.org/). If you
don't publish your gem on rubygems, users will still be able to install it if it
is located in a public git repository. To publish your gem on rubygems, you will
first need to [make an account on
rubygems](https://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/#publishing-to-rubygemsorg) and
then run `gem build *.gemspec` and `gem push *.gem`.
