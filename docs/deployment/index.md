# Deploying Inferno
Deployments of Inferno are based on the [test kit
template](https://github.com/inferno-framework/inferno-template). This template
contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that can run all of the services inferno
needs.

At a minimum, deploying inferno involves the following:
- `git clone` the repository you want to deploy (or get it onto your server in
  some other way)
- run `setup.sh` to pull & build the needed docker images and run database
  migrations
- run `docker-compose up -d` to start all of the services in the background

## Services
By default, a deployment of Inferno includes the following services:

- `nginx` - A reverse proxy which handles sending requests to the correct
  services
- `inferno` - The inferno web process which serves Inferno's static assets and
  the JSON API
- `worker` - The inferno web process which actually executes tests
- `redis` - Redis handles communication between the inferno web and worker
  processes
- `validator_service` - [A JSON API wrapper around the HL7 FHIR
  validator](https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper) which
  Inferno uses to validate FHIR resources
- `fhir_validator_app` - (Optional) [A web front end for the validator
  service](https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-app) which allows
  users to easily perform standalone FHIR resource validation. Nothing depends
  on this service, so it can be safely removed from `docker-compose.yml` if you
  don't need to provide standalone FHIR resource validation.
