# Hostname and Path Configuration
Inferno needs to know the URL where it is being hosted, and it determines this
based on environment variables. These environment variables need to be set in
both the web and worker processes. Some tests need to generate links to Inferno,
so the worker process needs to know where Inferno is hosted even though it isn't
serving those urls itself.

## Hostname Configuration
Set the `INFERNO_HOST` environment variable in `.env` to tell Inferno what its
host and scheme are. This allows Inferno to correctly construct things like
absolute redirect and launch urls for the SMART App Launch workflow.

## Base Path Configuration
If Inferno won't be hosted at the root of its host (e.g., you want to host
Inferno at `http://example.com/inferno` rather than at `http://example.com`):
- Set the `BASE_PATH` environment variable in `.env`
- In `nginx.conf`, change `location /` to `location /your_base_path`
