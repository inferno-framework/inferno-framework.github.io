Inferno Test Kits double as both Ruby gems and applications.
[Inferno Platforms](https://github.com/inferno-framework/inferno-platform-template/)
can load multiple Test Kits as Ruby gems together, offering a unified interface
for hosting a set of Test Kit on shared infrastructure. This is different from
[deploying individual Test Kits](/docs/deployment), even if they share a database or
other host resources. The primary advantages are:
 - A dashboard for Test Kit usage
 - News and other non-Test-Kit pages
 - Filtering Test Kits by tag
 - Data retention and clearing policies

See the [Inferno Platform Template](https://github.com/inferno-framework/inferno-platform-template/) repository
for instructions on getting started, adding Test Kits, and other features.
