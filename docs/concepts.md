# Key Concepts

This page provides an overview of the major concepts within Inferno that
will help you understand how and when to use Inferno.
{: .lead }


## Inferno Test Kit

A distributable set of tests and tools built and packaged
using Inferno to help testers evaluate the conformance of a system to
requirements of the FHIR base specification, relevant FHIR Implementation
Guides, and any additional requirements.  Example: the ONC g10 certification
test kit. Test kits primarily are composed of a Test Suite, which represents
executable tests, but may include other tools such as FHIR resource validators
or reference implementations.  

## Inferno Deployment
A web host that is running one or more Inferno Test Kits.  Inferno Test Kits can
be run as an Inferno Deployment on users local machines without any additional
configuration. Alternately, an Inferno Deployment can host multiple Inferno Test
Kits and run on a shared service, such as is the case for
https://inferno.healthit.gov.  A deployment provides a web interface as well as
a RESTful API to enable third party integration.

## Inferno Test Suite

An executable set of tests provided within an Inferno Test Kit that allows
testers to evaluate the conformance of a system.  The tests are organized
hierarchically.  They may import tests from other Test Kits.  It may be the
expectation of a Test Suite that a conformant system will pass all provided
tests, or that the system may fail some tests.  An individual test suite defines
how to interpret failures at the test level and in aggregate.

## Inferno Core

The primary library of inferno, which testers can use to build Inferno Test
Kits.  It provides the main logic of Inferno.  It provides a CLI, a web
interface for executing tests, integration with data persistence layers and 3rd
party validators.  Conceptually, Inferno core is similar to Ruby on Rails or
React + create-react-app.

## Inferno Template

A starting point for writing new Inferno Test Suites.

## Inferno Test DSL
A Domain Specific Language (DSL) that test writers use to define the tests
provided in the Inferno Test Suite. The DSL provides built-in functionality
useful in testing FHIR APIs, such as FHIR client and built-in assertion
libraries.  See documentation.

## Inferno Validators

 Tools that validate the correctness of a piece of data against a set of rules
 defined within a context.  Inferno Tests typically fetch data and validate the
 response using a validator.  Examples: FHIR Profile Validator, FHIR Terminology
 Validator.  Inferno typically performs these functions by providing common
 third party validators (e.g. HL7 FHIR Validator).

## Inferno Reference Implementations

An Inferno Test Kit may provide one or more Reference Implementations, which can
be useful to develop tests against or to help interact with third party
solutions.  Example: G10 Reference API.
